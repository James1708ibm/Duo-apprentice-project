                One day while on his way to make ketchup biscuits for breakfast,<br> he stubbed his toe on an ottoman.<br>
                In that moment,<br> he realized the ottoman served no purpose and burned it.<br>
                From then he vowed to make everyone in the world a minimalist.<br>
                Agree to his demands before he burns your furniture!<br>
                The legendary Vlad stubbed his toe and now all furniture must go! The war on furniture begins!</marquee>
