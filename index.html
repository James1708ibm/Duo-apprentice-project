            <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="up" scrollamount="1" > Long ago in the 1400s lived a royal named Vlad. 
                One day while on his way to make ketchup biscuits for breakfast he stubbed his toe on an ottoman. 
                He realized the ottoman was served no purpose and burned it.
                from then he vowed to make everyone in the world a minimalist.
                Agree to his demands before he burns your furniture.
                The legendary Vlad stubbed his toe and now all furniture must go! The war on furniture begins!</marquee>
